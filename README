This colorscheme uses a dark background with a slight red tint.
The syntax elements have colors mostly different from red so its easy for the eye to catch different elements.

I mostly use it for python/d code. As this theme is still very new, there might be some important highlighting groups missing atm, sorry for that.

Edit: Support for this theme is discontinued. If you are really a fan of it, contact me via http://leetless.de, if I see some request for this theme I might continue to support it.
